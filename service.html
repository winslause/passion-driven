                    Our emphasis and base on informing, training and guiding young girls on menstrual hygiene, menstrual hygiene products usage and disposal, sexual health, GBV and Rape.  <br><br>
                    The above topics are all well scripted in our manual guide book which enables smooth facilitation of our classes. <br><br>
                    The program is also incorporated with life skills and mentorship to break the monotony of classroom boredom and to enable the girls keep informed of values, code of conduct and self-actualization in day-to-day life. <br><br>
                    After completion of the course our aim is to have champions and leaders whom can share and guide others through the training given unto them. We also promote a number of girls into our main group as beneficiaries of part of the program to help us whenever we do facilitation on the same topics to girls of their same age.

                    Growing up in Kibera we had a lot of playing fields as we continue growing so does the developments around our locality hence the space which was used as playing field were develop and it was difficult now for us to go and play football and most of sports this pose a huge risk to the generation which is coming up since they have a lot of time if not well utilized it can go to waste. Secondly Kibera being largest informal settlements In Nairobi when kids get a lot of time, they may end up in substance abuse in boys and teenage pregnancy in girls, with this we introduced chess in Kibera.  <br><br>
                    Our classes run each Saturday from 2:00 - 4:00pm at Anajali primary school, besides chess we do mentorship to the kids and also have a group therapy where they talk on how they feel. Apart from having fun chess has diverse skills like critical and analytical thinking, responsibility, turn taking improving and sharpening their memories. these lessons equip the kids with lifelong skills which they will use after school and beyond we believe the way to save the future is to start small.

                    Cultural Protection </h1>
                <p>Culture plays an essential role in the life of a person and society. It acts as a means of accumulation, storage, and transmission of human experience. It is the culture that shapes people where they can gain knowledge, learn language,
                    symbols, values, norms, customs, and traditions. Culture and society related with each other. Without culture society cannot develop and without society culture cannot develop. With improved learning and health, increased tolerance
                    and opportunities to come together with others. Culture enhances our quality of life and increases overall well being for both.
